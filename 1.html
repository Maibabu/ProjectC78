            My Mom is always pretty and she likes to do make up. I like to cook with my mom
            and she loves to paint. My Dad is really kind and even caring,helpful.
            My dad once helped me when I was doing my homework, he explained very well that I could understand.
            My brother is very kind and also helpful like my dad, but my brother likes to have a good time with each other.
            He is my best brother ever! last but not least me, I am the sister and I like to draw and ride my bike in the summer.
            I like to spend time with my family and my friends. This is all about my family.
